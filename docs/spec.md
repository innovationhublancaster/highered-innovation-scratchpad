# HigherEd Innovation Scratchpad

## Problem Statement
Faculty, researchers, instructional designers and campus innovators frequently start with loose ideas or emerging technologies but lack a lightweight, higher-education–specific tool to quickly explore pedagogical, research, funding, compliance and operational fit. Existing tools are either generic note apps (no structure) or heavy project-management suites (too rigid). This results in lost ideas, long proposal prep cycles, duplicated work across departments, unclear pilot paths, and missed funding or curricular opportunities.

## Proposed Solution
A digital scratchpad designed for early-stage idea exploration in higher education: flexible, guided, and institution-aware. It lets users capture an idea quickly, then step through configurable exploration templates (teaching, research, commercialization, community partnership) with guided prompts, automated synthesis, and built-in checks for IRB/ethics, IP, funding fit and curriculum alignment. The product supports lightweight collaboration (commenting, anonymous feedback), easy export into pitches/proposals/LMS modules, simple pilot planning and experiment tracking, and integrations with campus systems (LMS, grants database, IP office) to move ideas from loose concept to funded pilot or classroom trial with minimal friction.

## Core Features
- Quick-capture canvas: title, one-sentence elevator, problem/insight, tech/solution, tags and attachments (images, links, papers) in <60s.
- Guided exploration templates: Research Canvas, Teaching Module Canvas, Lean Startup Canvas, Community Partnership Canvas — each with targeted prompts and checklists tailored to higher ed use cases.
- AI-assisted synthesis and summarization: auto-generate short abstracts, 3-slide pitch, research hypotheses, and an initial course activity/outcome mapping from the captured notes.
- Stakeholder & ecosystem mapping: visual map to identify faculty, departments, students, industry partners, campus offices (IT, legal, IRB, commercialization), and estimated effort/cost per stakeholder.
- Funding & grant-fit scanner: suggest internal seed funds and external grant programs based on topic/keywords and surface upcoming deadlines (integrates with campus grants database or public APIs).
- Compliance & IP checklist: automated prompts for IRB, FERPA, data/privacy, export controls, and IP disclosure; links to campus office contacts and templated next steps.
- Curriculum alignment tools: map idea to program learning outcomes, suggest course-level activities, estimate credit/non-credit fit, and produce an LMS-ready module skeleton.
- Pilot planner & experiment tracker: define objectives, hypotheses, metrics, sample sizes, timeline, budget estimate and simple Kanban for pilot tasks; capture results and iterate.
- Collaboration & feedback modes: private projects, shared labs (department), and anonymous campus-wide idea board for cross-pollination; threaded comments and version history.
- Export & pitch packs: export to slide deck, one-page concept note, IRB pre-screening form, grant concept note template, or LMS import package (SCORM/LTI-ready skeleton).
- Workshops & cohort mode: facilitator tools to run ideation sprints or semester-long cohorts with assignment templates, progress dashboards and peer-review flows.
- Analytics & discovery feed: dashboards showing idea pipeline, heatmaps of topics, cross-department activity, and recommendations for collaborators or courses that reference similar keywords.
- Privacy & governance controls: per-idea visibility settings, retention rules, and admin controls for discovery across campus; compliance logging for audits.
- Integrations & automations: single sign-on (SSO), LMS (Canvas/Blackboard/Moodle), campus grants/finance system, calendar, email, and optional API for institutional data.
- Lightweight commercialization tracker: record IP notes, contacts in the tech-transfer office, early market assessment and next steps toward disclosure or spinout.

## Target Users
Primary: faculty (tenured/tenure-track and adjunct), graduate students and postdocs, instructional designers, campus innovation/entrepreneurship office staff, research administrators, and teaching-focused centers. Secondary: department chairs, provost-level innovation leads, community partnership coordinators and incubator managers who need a low-friction way to scout and shepherd early ideas.

## Success Criteria
- Adoption: 500 active campus users within 6 months of pilot; 2,000 unique ideas captured within first 12 months.
- Pipeline conversion: at least 20% of captured ideas progress to a defined pilot plan within 3 months of capture.
- Funding outcomes: 25+ internal seed applications or 20 external grant proposals initiated that reference scratchpad outputs within 12 months.
- Teaching outcomes: 50 LMS-ready module skeletons or course activities exported and piloted in semester courses within first academic year.
- Time-to-prototype reduction: average time from idea capture to pilot kickoff reduced by 40% compared to baseline (measured through pilot cohorts).
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration: increase cross-department co-authored ideas by 30% (tracked via stakeholder mapping) within 12 months.
- User satisfaction: average system SUS >70 or NPS >=30 in semesterly surveys.
- Compliance & handoff: 80% of ideas flagged as human-subjects relevant have an IRB pre-screen recorded in the system; 90% of ideas progressing to commercialization have a documented IP contact.
- Engagement depth: median of 3 template sections completed per idea and average of 2 collaborator comments per active idea.
- Operational ROI: measurable reduction in duplicated proposal work (e.g., fewer than 10% of ideas duplicated across departments after discovery feed rollout) and positive feedback from at least two campus offices (IT, Grants, or Tech Transfer) on reduced friction for handoffs.
