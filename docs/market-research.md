{"risks":["Integration complexity and variability: deep value requires heterogeneous, often legacy campus integrations (SSO, LMS, grants DB) that lengthen sales and implementation cycles.","Governance & legal trust: IRB/FERPA/IP concerns and AI hallucination risk will block pilots without auditable processes and institutional sign-off.","Unclear buyer & funding path: primary users lack procurement power; central offices buy but have different ROI expectations and long cycles.","Feature-breadth trap: attempting to ship the full value chain at once will delay time‑to‑value and make pilot scope unmanageable.","Procurement/security barriers: vendor reviews, SOC2/data residency, BAAs and accessibility requirements can prevent campus adoption.","Evidence gap on willingness to pay: no confirmed pilot contracts or WTP data yet; reliance on trend signals is insufficient to justify heavy investment.","Operational scale burden: scaling across campuses requires CS/onboarding resources, custom integrations and long-term runway."],"goNoGo":"caution","summary":"The research shows a real, timely opportunity: universities consistently struggle with scattered idea capture, slow proposal-to-pilot cycles, and poor handoffs to IRB, grants and tech‑transfer—problems the proposed HigherEd Innovation Scratchpad is well positioned to solve. Users (faculty, instructional designers, innovation office staff, grad students) strongly want instant capture, guided templates, AI-assisted synthesis, LMS export and compliance checklists. Market sizing (TAM ~$500M, SAM ~$150–200M, realistic SOM $2.5–4M in 24–36 months) and trend signals (rapid GenAI adoption, hybrid learning, outcome-driven procurement) provide supportive tailwinds. Competitive analysis shows no direct, institution-aware incumbent that bundles quick capture + higher-ed compliance + LMS export, making a differentiated position plausible.\n\nHowever, adoption is gated by significant practical obstacles. Deep integrations (SSO, LMS, grants DB), stringent governance and audit requirements (IRB/FERPA/IP), long procurement cycles, and buyer ambiguity (faculty users vs. central purchasers) create high friction and execution risk. AI hallucination risk and the need for legally credible outputs mean trust-building is essential. The product achieves mid-high PMF (score = 6): strong alignment with pain and trends, but requires a narrow, pilotable MVP, robust compliance features, and a clear enterprise sales and monetization plan before scaling.","nextSteps":["Define and build a tightly scoped MVP (12–16 weeks) focused on one high-leverage workflow—recommendation: 'Seed-grant → pilot' or 'Idea → LMS‑ready module'—including: quick-capture canvas, guided templates, AI-assisted pitch + LMS export, and per-idea privacy controls.","Pilot with 3–5 innovation-forward campuses (innovation hubs / CTLs / TTO) under paid pilot agreements: require measurable success metrics (time-to-prototype reduction, pilot conversion rate, number of concept notes submitted) and collect WTP commitments before investing in deeper integrations.","Ship low-friction integrations first: SSO (OIDC/SAML), LTI/SCORM export skeletons for Canvas, and calendar/email exports. Defer heavy grants/SIS/finance integrations until pilots prove ROI.","Invest in governance & trust features from day one: per-idea visibility, retention policies, tamper-evident audit logs, explicit IRB/TTO template library co‑developed with partner campuses, and human-in-the-loop sign‑offs for compliance-sensitive outputs.","Mitigate AI risk: display provenance/confidence metadata, require source citations for generated summaries, and implement an edit-and-approve flow for any output intended for formal IRB/grant/TTO use.","Design pilot commercial terms and pricing: offer limited-seat paid pilots (6–12 months) priced to cover onboarding + small integration work ($15–30k depending on institution size), plus a discounted early institutional subscription option contingent on success metrics.","Build a campus champion program: recruit faculty fellows, instructional designer ambassadors and innovation-office sponsors to drive adoption, generate case studies, and expedite procurement within their institutions.","Prepare compliance and procurement materials: SOC2 roadmap, BAA templates, accessibility attestations (WCAG), data residency options, and standard legal responses to campus vendor questionnaires to shorten review cycles.","Instrument pilots for hard ROI proof: capture baseline and post-pilot metrics (idea throughput, time-to-prototype, pilot conversion, grant applications started, user WTP) and publish 2–3 case studies with quantified outcomes to support sales.","Plan integration roadmap and success criteria: only commit to deep grants/SIS/TTO integrations after achieving X paid pilots, Y ARR, and validated need; prioritize partner APIs (Pivot, Cayuse, Canvas) and consortia deals for multi-campus scale."],"strengths":["Clear problem–solution fit: addresses documented, high‑value university pain points (idea loss, slow prep, handoff friction).","Timing and trends aligned: GenAI adoption, hybrid learning and ROI-focused procurement favor the product now.","High-demand core features: must-have features (60s capture, guided templates, AI synthesis, LMS export, compliance controls) are strongly validated by users.","Distinct differentiation vs. generic tools: combines rapid capture and higher-ed-specific compliance/export workflows missing from Notion/Miro/Canvas/Cayuse.","Attractive initial customers: innovation hubs, CTLs and tech-transfer offices are willing champions and logical paying pilots.","Tangible near-term market: SAM is meaningful and a realistic SOM (~$2.5–4M ARR) can be reached with pilot-first GTM.","Designable trust controls: provenance, audit logs and co-developed templates can materially reduce institutional resistance."]}
